# About Me

*   *   *

Hi! Welcome to my page. On being a geophysicist, I am a PhD student at [Caltech Seismolab](http://www.seismolab.caltech.edu/liu_yk.html) working under the mentorship of [Mark Simons](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~simons/) and [Zach Ross](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~zross/). My research incorporates spacebourne geodesy and statistical techniques on seismicity to understand geophysical processes associated with seismic cycles, aseismic tectonic deformation, caldera unrests and collapses.

To see my publications, please visit my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?authuser=1&user=YCCuojgAAAAJ).

If interested in some of the softwares, codes that I am using, visit my [GitHub page](https://github.com/yuankailiu).
