# About Me

*   *   *

Hi! Welcome to my page. I am a graduate student at [Caltech Seismolab](https://www.seismolab.caltech.edu) working under the mentorship of [Mark Simons](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~simons/) and [Zach Ross](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~zross/). My research incorporates space geodesy and statistical methods on seismicity to understand geophysical processes associated with seismic cycles, aseismic deformation, and tectonic processes. In the past, I also work with [Sigurjón Jónsson](https://cdi.kaust.edu.sa/people/detail/sigurj%C3%B3n-j%C3%B3nsson) in KAUST on the crustal deformation of caldera collapses.
