# About Me

Hi! I am a geophysicist and PhD student at [Caltech Seismolab](http://www.seismolab.caltech.edu/liu_yk.html) working under the mentorship of [Mark Simons](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~simons/) and [Zach Ross](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~zross/). I am interested in applying space-bourne geodesy and statistical seismicity techniques to understand geophysical processes associated with seismic cycles, aseismic tectonic deformation, caldera unrests and subsidence.

To see my publications, please see my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?authuser=1&user=YCCuojgAAAAJ).

If you are interested in some of the softwares, codes I am working on, visit my [GitHub page](https://github.com/yuankailiu).
